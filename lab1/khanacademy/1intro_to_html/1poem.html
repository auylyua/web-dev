        <h1>the girl from ipanema</h1>
        <p>
            Tall and tan and young and lovely<br>
The girl from Ipanema goes walking<br>
And when she passes<br>
Each one she passes goes, "Ah"<br><br>
When she walks, she's like a samba<br>
That swings so cool and sways so gentle<br>
That when she passes<br>
Each one she passes goes, "Ooh"<br>
But I watch her so sadly<br><br>
How can I tell her I love her?<br>
Yes, I would give my heart gladly<br>
But each day, when she walks to the sea<br>
She looks straight ahead, not at me<br>
